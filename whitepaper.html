    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Pryme is an interactive, lightweight, and powerful blockchain that provides a
      universal, self-sustaining system for database creation, private-key
      management, and reward-based node participation. It supports peer-to-peer coin
      transfers with an integrated audit system, enabling users to seamlessly debug
      their keys and interact with the chain through simple inputs. Participants may
      register their wallet addresses to earn rewards by running nodes, all within a
      robust and energy-efficient framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built entirely in Rust, Pryme leverages Rustâ€™s safety guarantees and includes
      built-in anomaly tracking and prevention. Users can audit the complete ledger
      in seconds and export it as JSON or PDF. Operating as a standalone system
      without third-party interference, Pryme delivers a minimalist yet vigorous
      interactive experience powered by cutting-edge technology.
